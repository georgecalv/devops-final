Welcome to myPL!

To see the program language in action with the tests implemented please watch a recording of myself going through and talking about this project [here]( https://gonzagau-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/gcalvert_zagmail_gonzaga_edu/Ealghs6g7EZNscRuGA6WEEMBqgDQneFTG9LznB_05g26hw?e=sE2Adc)
  
Run make build-deb then dpkg -i mypl.deb then you will be able to use the mypl.py programming language

To use run mypl.py "filename.mypl"
